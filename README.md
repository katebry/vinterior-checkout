## Tech test for Vinterior

Created a checkout function that takes two parameters - the product barcode and the products object (to emulate what an actual checkout would do - scan a code then check it against a value in a db to find the price.) 🛒💵

Built using Javascript.

Tests written using mocha and chai. ☕️
